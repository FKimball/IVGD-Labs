 Labs for Intro to Video Game Design

Sprites (In main scene):
1. Kiryu from Yakuza 
2. Sprite Can 

Backgorund Scene (nested to main scene with sprites):
1. Sun
2. Cityscape 

I thought this project was helpful for learning about how objects and scenes work in Godot. It helped me better understand the base elements of the program and how they interact with each other.
